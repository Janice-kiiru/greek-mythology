    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>Each god descends from his or her own genealogy, pursues differing interests, has a certain area of expertise, and is governed by a unique personality; however, these descriptions arise from a multiplicity of archaic local variants, which do not always agree with one another. When these gods are called upon in poetry, prayer, or cult, they are referred to by a combination of their name and epithets, that identify them by these distinctions from other manifestations of themselves</p>

            In Greek mythology, the gods and goddesses are central figures in a
            complex narrative that explains the world and human experience. At
             the head of this pantheon is Zeus, the powerful ruler of Mount Olympus
              and the sky, often depicted with a thunderbolt in hand. His wife Hera,
               the goddess of marriage and childbirth, stands by his side, though their
                relationship is often tumultuous due to Zeus's many affairs.
           Among Zeus's siblings are Poseidon, god of the sea and earthquakes, and Hades, ruler
          of the underworld. Poseidon commands the oceans with his trident, while Hades
           oversees the realm of the dead. The siblings are both powerful in their own right 
         but often overshadowed by Zeus's authority. Athena, born fully grown from Zeus's head, 
          is the goddess of wisdom, warfare, and civilization. She is a strategic thinker and 
           protector of cities, notably Athens, which bears her name. Her brother Apollo, god of
         the sun, music, and prophecy, is equally versatile, often depicted with a lyre or bow. 
         Apollo's twin sister Artemis, goddess of the hunt and wilderness, shares his independence
          and is often accompanied by a retinue of nymphs and woodland creatures.
         Ares, the volatile god of war, revels in chaos and conflict, while his sister Aphrodite 
          embodies love, beauty, and desire. Despite her captivating charm, Aphrodite's romantic 
         entanglements often lead to jealousy and discord among the gods
         Hermes, the swift messenger of the gods, is known for his cunning and versatility. As 
         the patron of travelers, merchants, and thieves, he bridges the gap between the divine and 
          mortal realms. Meanwhile, Hephaestus, the crippled god of fire and craftsmanship, creates exquisite 
         works of art from his forge beneath Mount Olympus.
        These gods and goddesses, with their intricate relationships and diverse domains, 
        form the tapestry of Greek mythology, shaping the fates of gods and mortals alike.
