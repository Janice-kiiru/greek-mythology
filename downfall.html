        <h2>Introduction:The Downfall of the gods</h2>
        <P>In the rich tapestry of Greek mythology,the gods and goddess of Mount Olympus reign supreme,
            wielding immense power and influence over the cosmos.Yet,even these divine beings are not immune to pitfalls of 
            mortal exsistence.Beyond their majestic thrones and divine splendor lies a world fraught with conflicts,hubris and 
            ultimately downfall.Join me on a journey through the annals of Greek mythology as i explore into the lives and fate 
            of Zeus,Cronus,Hades,Poseidon,Ares,Athena,Medusa and other gods for even themselves are not immune to the inexorable
            march of fate,and their downfall serves as poignant reminder of the fragility of power and inevitaility of consequence.

        </P>

        <P>Zeus,faced numerous challenges throughout his reign,including threats to his power and authority.
            Due to the prophecy that his father feard that one of his offspring will overthrow him,which lead him
            to swallow each of his children,Zeus was saved by his mother Rhea and Zeus eventually overthrew Cronus.
